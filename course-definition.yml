      In this stage, you'll create a TCP server that listens on port 4221.

      [TCP](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-ca/learning/ddos/glossary/tcp-ip/) is the underlying protocol used by HTTP servers.


      ### Tests

      The tester will execute your program like this:

      ```
      $ ./your_server.sh
      ```

      Then, the tester will try to connect to your server on port 4221. The connection must succeed for you to pass this stage.

    name: "Respond with 200"
    difficulty: very_easy
    description_md: |-
      In this stage, your server will respond to an HTTP request with a `200` response.

      ### HTTP response

      An HTTP response is made up of three parts, each separated by a [CRLF](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CRLF) (`\r\n`):
      1.  Status line.
      2.  Zero or more headers, each ending with a CRLF.
      3.  Optional response body.

      In this stage, your server's response will only contain a status line. Here's the response your server must send:
      ```javascript
      HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n\r\n
      ```

      Here's a breakdown of the response:
      ```javascript
      // Status line
      HTTP/1.1  // HTTP version
      200       // Status code
      OK        // Optional reason phrase
      \r\n      // CRLF that marks the end of the status line

      // Headers (empty)
      \r\n      // CRLF that marks the end of the headers

      // Response body (empty)
      ```

      ### Tests

      The tester will execute your program like this:
      ```bash
      $ ./your_server.sh
      ```

      The tester will then send an HTTP `GET` request to your server:
      ```bash
      $ curl -i http://localhost:4221
      ```

      Your server must respond to the request with the following response:
      ```javascript
      HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n\r\n
      ```

      ### Notes

      - You can ignore the contents of the request. We'll cover parsing requests in later stages.
      - For more information about HTTP responses, see the [MDN Web Docs on HTTP responses](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Messages#http_responses) or the [HTTP/1.1 specification](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9112#name-message).
      - This challenge uses HTTP/1.1.

    ]
    name: "Respond with 404"
    difficulty: easy
    description_md: |-
      In this stage, your program will need to extract the path from the HTTP request.

      Here's what the contents of a HTTP request look like:

      ```
      GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
      Host: localhost:4221
      User-Agent: curl/7.64.1
      ```

      - `GET /index.html HTTP/1.1` is the [start line](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Messages#start_line).
          - `GET` is the [HTTP method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods).
          - `/index.html` is the [path](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Messages#path).
          - `HTTP/1.1` is the [HTTP version](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Messages#http_versions).
      - `Host: localhost:4221` and `User-Agent: curl/7.64.1` are [HTTP headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Messages#headers).
      - Note that all of these lines are separated by `\r\n`, not just `\n`.

      In this stage, we'll only focus on extracting the path from the request.

      If the path is `/`, you'll need to respond with a 200 OK response. Otherwise, you'll need to respond with a 404 Not Found response.

    ]
    name: "Respond with content"
    difficulty: easy
    description_md: |-
      In this stage, your program will need to respond with a body. In the
      previous stages we were only sending a status code, no body.

      The task here is to parse the path from the HTTP request. We will send a
      random string in the url path you will need to parse that string and then
      respond with the parsed string (only) in the response body.

      The tester will send you a request of the form
      `GET /echo/<a-random-string>`.

      Your program will need to respond with a 200 OK response. The response
      should have a content type of `text/plain`, and it should contain the
      random string as the body.

      As an example, here's a request you might receive:

      ```
      GET /echo/abc HTTP/1.1
      Host: localhost:4221
      User-Agent: curl/7.64.1
      ```

      And here's the response you're expected to send back:

      ```
      HTTP/1.1 200 OK
      Content-Type: text/plain
      Content-Length: 3

      abc
      ```

      Remember, lines in the response are separated by `\r\n`, not just `\n`.
