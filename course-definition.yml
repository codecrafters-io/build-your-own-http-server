      In this stage, you'll create a TCP server that listens on port 4221.

      [TCP](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-ca/learning/ddos/glossary/tcp-ip/) is the underlying protocol used by HTTP servers.


      ### Tests

      The tester will execute your program like this:

      ```
      $ ./your_server.sh
      ```

      Then, the tester will try to connect to your server on port 4221. The connection must succeed for you to pass this stage.

      ]
    name: "Respond with 200"
    difficulty: very_easy
    description_md: |-
      In this stage, your server will respond to an HTTP request with a `200` response.

      ### HTTP response

      An HTTP response is made up of three parts, each separated by a [CRLF](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CRLF) (`\r\n`):
      1.  Status line.
      2.  Zero or more headers, each ending with a CRLF.
      3.  Optional response body.

      In this stage, your server's response will only contain a status line. Here's the response your server must send:
      ```javascript
      HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n\r\n
      ```

      Here's a breakdown of the response:
      ```javascript
      // Status line
      HTTP/1.1  // HTTP version
      200       // Status code
      OK        // Optional reason phrase
      \r\n      // CRLF that marks the end of the status line

      // Headers (empty)
      \r\n      // CRLF that marks the end of the headers

      // Response body (empty)
      ```

      ### Tests

      The tester will execute your program like this:
      ```bash
      $ ./your_server.sh
      ```

      The tester will then send an HTTP `GET` request to your server:
      ```bash
      $ curl -i http://localhost:4221
      ```

      Your server must respond to the request with the following response:
      ```javascript
      HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n\r\n
      ```

      ### Notes

      - You can ignore the contents of the request. We'll cover parsing requests in later stages.
      - For more information about HTTP responses, see the [MDN Web Docs on HTTP responses](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Messages#http_responses) or the [HTTP/1.1 specification](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9112#name-message).
      - This challenge uses HTTP/1.1.

    name: "Extract URL path"
    difficulty: easy
    description_md: |-
      In this stage, your server will extract the URL path from an HTTP request, and respond with either a `200` or `404`, depending on the path.

      ### HTTP request

      An HTTP request is made up of three parts, each separated by a [CRLF](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CRLF) (`\r\n`):

      1.  Request line.
      2.  Zero or more headers, each ending with a CRLF.
      3.  Optional request body.

      Here's an example of an HTTP request:
      ```javascript
      GET /index.html HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: localhost:4221\r\nUser-Agent: curl/7.64.1\r\nAccept: */*\r\n\r\n
      ```

      Here's a breakdown of the request:
      ```javascript
      // Request line
      GET                          // HTTP method
      /index.html                  // Request target
      HTTP/1.1                     // HTTP version
      \r\n                         // CRLF that marks the end of the request line

      // Headers
      Host: localhost:4221\r\n     // Header that specifies the server's host and port
      User-Agent: curl/7.64.1\r\n  // Header that describes the client's user agent
      Accept: */*\r\n              // Header that specifies which media types the client can accept
      \r\n                         // CRLF that marks the end of the headers

      // Request body (empty)
      ```

      The "request target" specifies the URL path for this request. In this example, the URL path is `/index.html`.

      Note that each header ends in a CRLF, and the entire header section also ends in a CRLF.

      ### Tests

      The tester will execute your program like this:
      ```bash
      $ ./your_server.sh
      ```

      The tester will then send two HTTP requests to your server.

      First, the tester will send a `GET` request, with a random string as the path:
      ```bash
      $ curl -i http://localhost:4221/abcdefg
      ```

      Your server must respond to this request with a `404` response:
      ```javascript
      HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found\r\n\r\n
      ```

      Then, the tester will send a `GET` request, with the path `/`:
      ```bash
      $ curl -i http://localhost:4221
      ```

      Your server must respond to this request with a `200` response:
      ```javascript
      HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n\r\n
      ```

      ### Notes

      - You can ignore the headers for now. You'll learn about parsing headers in a later stage.
      - In this stage, the request target is written as a URL path. But the request target actually has [four possible formats](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9112#section-3.2). The URL path format is called the "origin form," and it's the most commonly used format. The other formats are used for more niche scenarios, like sending a request through a proxy.
      - For more information about HTTP requests, see the [MDN Web Docs on HTTP requests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Messages#http_requests) or the [HTTP/1.1 specification](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9112#name-message).

      In this stage, you'll add support for returning a 404 response if a path isn't valid.

    slug: "cn2"
    name: "Respond with body"
    difficulty: easy
    description_md: |-
      In this stage, you'll implement the `/echo/{str}` endpoint, which accepts a string and returns it in the response body.

      ### Response body

      A response body is used to return content to the client. This content may be an entire web page, a file, a string, or anything else that can be represented with bytes.

      Your `/echo/{str}` endpoint must return a `200` response, with the response body set to given string, and with a `Content-Type` and `Content-Length` header.

      Here's an example of an `/echo/{str}` request:
      ```javascript
      GET /echo/abc HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: localhost:4221\r\nUser-Agent: curl/7.64.1\r\nAccept: */*\r\n\r\n
      ```

      And here's the expected response:
      ```javascript
      HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\nContent-Type: text/plain\r\nContent-Length: 3\r\n\r\nabc
      ```

      Here's a breakdown of the response:
      ```javascript
      // Status line
      HTTP/1.1 200 OK
      \r\n                          // CRLF that marks the end of the status line

      // Headers
      Content-Type: text/plain\r\n  // Header that specifies the format of the response body
      Content-Length: 3\r\n         // Header that specifies the size of the response body, in bytes
      \r\n                          // CRLF that marks the end of the headers

      // Response body
      abc                           // The string from the request
      ```

      The two headers are required for the client to be able to parse the response body. Note that each header ends in a CRLF, and the entire header section also ends in a CRLF.

      ### Tests

      The tester will execute your program like this:
      ```bash
      $ ./your_server.sh
      ```

      The tester will then send a `GET` request to the `/echo/{str}` endpoint on your server, with some random string.
      ```bash
      $ curl -i http://localhost:4221/echo/abc
      ```

      Your server must respond with a `200` response that contains the following parts:
      - `Content-Type` header set to `text/plain`.
      - `Content-Length` header set to the length of the given string.
      - Response body set to the given string.
      ```javascript
      HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\nContent-Type: text/plain\r\nContent-Length: 3\r\n\r\nabc
      ```

      ### Notes
      - For more information about HTTP responses, see the [MDN Web Docs on HTTP responses](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Messages#http_responses) or the [HTTP/1.1 specification](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9112#name-message).

      In this stage, you'll add support for responding with a custom body in your HTTP response.

  - legacy_slug: "parse-headers"
    slug: "fs3"
    name: "Read header"
    difficulty: easy
    description_md: |-
      In this stage, you'll implement the `/user-agent` endpoint, which reads the `User-Agent` request header and returns it in the response body.

      ### The `User-Agent` header

      The [`User-Agent`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/User-Agent) header describes the client's user agent.

      Your `/user-agent` endpoint must read the `User-Agent` header, and return it in your response body. Here's an example of a `/user-agent` request:
      ```javascript
      // Request line
      GET
      /user-agent
      HTTP/1.1
      \r\n

      // Headers
      Host: localhost:4221\r\n
      User-Agent: foobar/1.2.3\r\n  // Read this value
      Accept: */*\r\n
      \r\n

      // Request body (empty)
      ```

      Here is the expected response:
      ```javascript
      // Status line
      HTTP/1.1 200 OK               // Status code must be 200
      \r\n

      // Headers
      Content-Type: text/plain\r\n
      Content-Length: 12\r\n
      \r\n

      // Response body
      foobar/1.2.3                  // The value of `User-Agent`
      ```

      ### Tests

      The tester will execute your program like this:
      ```bash
      $ ./your_server.sh
      ```

      The tester will then send a `GET` request to the `/user-agent` endpoint on your server. The request will have a `User-Agent` header.
      ```bash
      $ curl -i --header "User-Agent: foobar/1.2.3" http://localhost:4221/user-agent
      ```

      Your server must respond with a `200` response that contains the following parts:
      - `Content-Type` header set to `text/plain`.
      - `Content-Length` header set to the length of the `User-Agent` value.
      - Message body set to the `User-Agent` value.
      ```javascript
      HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\nContent-Type: text/plain\r\nContent-Length: 12\r\n\r\nfoobar/1.2.3
      ```

      The tester will execute your program like this:
      ```bash
      $ ./your_server.sh
      ```

      Then, the tester will create multiple concurrent TCP connections to your server. (The exact number of connections is determined at random.) After that, the tester will send a single `GET` request through each of the connections.
      ```bash
      $ (sleep 3 && printf "GET / HTTP/1.1\r\n\r\n") | nc localhost 4221 &
      $ (sleep 3 && printf "GET / HTTP/1.1\r\n\r\n") | nc localhost 4221 &

      It'll then send you a request of the form `POST /files/<filename>`. The request body will contain the contents of the file.

      You'll need to fetch the contents of the file from the request body and save it to `<directory>/<filename>`. The response code
      returned should be 201.

      It'll then send an HTTP `GET` request to the `/echo/<a-random-string>` endpoint. In the request, it'll include an Accept-Encoding header like: `Accept-Encoding: gzip`.
      As an example, here's a request you might receive:

      ```
      GET /echo/foo HTTP/1.1
      Host: localhost:4221
      User-Agent: curl/7.64.1
      Accept-Encoding: gzip
      ```

      Your server must respond with a `200 OK` response. The response should have a `Content-Encoding: gzip` header present. The response body will not be tested in this stage. (We will tackle the actual compression in a later stage)
      Here's the response you're expected to send back:

      ```
      HTTP/1.1 200 OK
      Content-Encoding: gzip
      Content-Type: text/plain
      Content-Length: 3

      foo
      ```

      It'll then send another HTTP `GET` request to the `/echo/<a-random-string>` endpoint. In the request, it'll include an Accept-Encoding header like: `Accept-Encoding: invalid-encoding`.
      But this time the Accept-Encoding header will be set to an invalid value (i.e. an encoding that your server doesn't support).
      As an example, here's a request you might receive:

      ```
      GET /echo/bar HTTP/1.1
      Host: localhost:4221
      User-Agent: curl/7.64.1
      Accept-Encoding: invalid-encoding
      ```

      Your server must respond with a `200 OK` response. The response should NOT have a `Content-Encoding` header present. The response body will not be tested in this stage.
      Here's the response you're expected to send back:

      ```
      HTTP/1.1 200 OK
      Content-Type: text/plain
      Content-Length: 3

      bar
      ```

      ### Notes

      1.  Header names are case-insensitive, i.e. `accept-encoding: gzip` and `Accept-Encoding: gzip` are equivalent. We won't test this explicitly in this challenge, but it's a good practice to lowercase your header names before comparison.

      In this stage, you'll add support for reading the `Accept-Encoding` header sent by clients, and respond with `Content-Encoding` header in your response.

      In this stage, you'll add support for choosing a compression scheme when multiple values are passed in via the `Accept-Encoding` header.

      ### Tests

      The tester will execute your program like this:

      ```bash
      ./your_server.sh
      ```

      It'll then send an HTTP `GET` request to the `/echo/<a-random-string>` endpoint. In the request, it'll include an Accept-Encoding header set to multiple values, like: `Accept-Encoding: encoding-1, gzip, encoding-2'.
      One of the values in the list will be `gzip`, but the other values will be invalid encoding names.
      As an example, here's a request you might receive:

      ```
      GET /echo/foo HTTP/1.1
      Host: localhost:4221
      User-Agent: curl/7.64.1
      Accept-Encoding: encoding-1, gzip, encoding-2
      ```

      Your server must respond with a `200 OK` response. The response should have a `Content-Encoding: gzip` header present. The response body will not be tested in this stage. (We will tackle the actual compression in a later stage)
      Here's the response you're expected to send back:

      ```
      HTTP/1.1 200 OK
      Content-Encoding: gzip
      Content-Type: text/plain
      Content-Length: 3

      foo
      ```

      It'll then send another HTTP `GET` request to the `/echo/<a-random-string>` endpoint. In the request, it'll include an Accept-Encoding header like: `Accept-Encoding: encoding-1, encoding-2`.
      But this time the Accept-Encoding header will not contain gzip, it'll only contain invalid values (i.e. encodings that your server doesn't support).
      As an example, here's a request you might receive:

      ```
      GET /echo/bar HTTP/1.1
      Host: localhost:4221
      User-Agent: curl/7.64.1
      Accept-Encoding: encoding-1, encoding-2
      ```

      Your server must respond with a `200 OK` response. The response should NOT have a `Content-Encoding` header present. The response body will not be tested in this stage.

      In this stage, you'll add support for reading multiple compression values from `Accept-Encoding` header sent by clients, and respond with `Content-Encoding` header in your response.

      In this stage, you'll add support for returning responses compressed using gzip.

      ### Tests

      The tester will execute your program like this:

      ```bash
      ./your_server.sh
      ```

      It'll then send an HTTP `GET` request to the `/echo/<a-random-string>` endpoint. In the request, it'll include an Accept-Encoding header like: `Accept-Encoding: gzip`.
      As an example, here's a request you might receive:

      ```
      GET /echo/foo HTTP/1.1
      Host: localhost:4221
      User-Agent: curl/7.64.1
      Accept-Encoding: gzip
      ```

      Your server must respond with a `200 OK` response. The response should have a `Content-Encoding: gzip` header present. The response body should be the random string sent in the request, gzip encoded. And the `Content-Length` header should be the length of the gzip encoded data.
      Here's the response you're expected to send back:
      If the raw string was `foo`, the hex encoded data would be `gzip-encoded-data`
      Hex representation of it would be `1f8b08008c643b6602ff4bcbcf07002165738c03000000`

      ```
      HTTP/1.1 200 OK
      Content-Encoding: gzip
      Content-Type: text/plain
      Content-Length: 23

      gzip-encoded-data
      ```

      In this stage, you'll add support for encoding the response body using `gzip`.
