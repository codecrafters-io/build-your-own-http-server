      In this stage, you'll create a TCP server that listens on port 4221.

      [TCP](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-ca/learning/ddos/glossary/tcp-ip/) is the underlying protocol used by HTTP servers.


      ### Tests

      The tester will execute your program like this:

      ```
      $ ./your_program.sh
      ```

      Then, the tester will try to connect to your server on port 4221. The connection must succeed for you to pass this stage.

    name: "Respond with 200"
    difficulty: very_easy
    description_md: |-
      In this stage, your server will respond to an HTTP request with a `200` response.

      ### HTTP response

      An HTTP response is made up of three parts, each separated by a [CRLF](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CRLF) (`\r\n`):
      1.  Status line.
      2.  Zero or more headers, each ending with a CRLF.
      3.  Optional response body.

      In this stage, your server's response will only contain a status line. Here's the response your server must send:
      ```javascript
      HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n\r\n
      ```

      Here's a breakdown of the response:
      ```javascript
      // Status line
      HTTP/1.1  // HTTP version
      200       // Status code
      OK        // Optional reason phrase
      \r\n      // CRLF that marks the end of the status line

      // Headers (empty)
      \r\n      // CRLF that marks the end of the headers

      // Response body (empty)
      ```

      ### Tests

      The tester will execute your program like this:
      ```bash
      $ ./your_program.sh
      ```

      The tester will then send an HTTP `GET` request to your server:
      ```bash
      $ curl -v http://localhost:4221
      ```

      Your server must respond to the request with the following response:
      ```javascript
      HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n\r\n
      ```

      ### Notes

      - You can ignore the contents of the request. We'll cover parsing requests in later stages.
      - For more information about HTTP responses, see the [MDN Web Docs on HTTP responses](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Messages#http_responses) or the [HTTP/1.1 specification](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9112#name-message).
      - This challenge uses HTTP/1.1.

    name: "Extract URL path"
    difficulty: easy
    description_md: |-
      In this stage, your server will extract the URL path from an HTTP request, and respond with either a `200` or `404`, depending on the path.

      ### HTTP request

      An HTTP request is made up of three parts, each separated by a [CRLF](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CRLF) (`\r\n`):

      1.  Request line.
      2.  Zero or more headers, each ending with a CRLF.
      3.  Optional request body.

      Here's an example of an HTTP request:
      ```javascript
      GET /index.html HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: localhost:4221\r\nUser-Agent: curl/7.64.1\r\nAccept: */*\r\n\r\n
      ```

      Here's a breakdown of the request:
      ```javascript
      // Request line
      GET                          // HTTP method
      /index.html                  // Request target
      HTTP/1.1                     // HTTP version
      \r\n                         // CRLF that marks the end of the request line

      // Headers
      Host: localhost:4221\r\n     // Header that specifies the server's host and port
      User-Agent: curl/7.64.1\r\n  // Header that describes the client's user agent
      Accept: */*\r\n              // Header that specifies which media types the client can accept
      \r\n                         // CRLF that marks the end of the headers

      // Request body (empty)
      ```

      The "request target" specifies the URL path for this request. In this example, the URL path is `/index.html`.

      Note that each header ends in a CRLF, and the entire header section also ends in a CRLF.

      ### Tests

      The tester will execute your program like this:
      ```bash
      $ ./your_program.sh
      ```

      The tester will then send two HTTP requests to your server.

      First, the tester will send a `GET` request, with a random string as the path:
      ```bash
      $ curl -v http://localhost:4221/abcdefg
      ```

      Your server must respond to this request with a `404` response:
      ```javascript
      HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found\r\n\r\n
      ```

      Then, the tester will send a `GET` request, with the path `/`:
      ```bash
      $ curl -v http://localhost:4221
      ```

      Your server must respond to this request with a `200` response:
      ```javascript
      HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n\r\n
      ```

      ### Notes

      - You can ignore the headers for now. You'll learn about parsing headers in a later stage.
      - In this stage, the request target is written as a URL path. But the request target actually has [four possible formats](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9112#section-3.2). The URL path format is called the "origin form," and it's the most commonly used format. The other formats are used for more niche scenarios, like sending a request through a proxy.
      - For more information about HTTP requests, see the [MDN Web Docs on HTTP requests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Messages#http_requests) or the [HTTP/1.1 specification](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9112#name-message).

  - slug: "cn2"
    name: "Respond with body"
    difficulty: easy
    description_md: |-
      In this stage, you'll implement the `/echo/{str}` endpoint, which accepts a string and returns it in the response body.

      ### Response body

      A response body is used to return content to the client. This content may be an entire web page, a file, a string, or anything else that can be represented with bytes.

      Your `/echo/{str}` endpoint must return a `200` response, with the response body set to given string, and with a `Content-Type` and `Content-Length` header.

      Here's an example of an `/echo/{str}` request:
      ```javascript
      GET /echo/abc HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: localhost:4221\r\nUser-Agent: curl/7.64.1\r\nAccept: */*\r\n\r\n
      ```

      And here's the expected response:
      ```javascript
      HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\nContent-Type: text/plain\r\nContent-Length: 3\r\n\r\nabc
      ```

      Here's a breakdown of the response:
      ```javascript
      // Status line
      HTTP/1.1 200 OK
      \r\n                          // CRLF that marks the end of the status line

      // Headers
      Content-Type: text/plain\r\n  // Header that specifies the format of the response body
      Content-Length: 3\r\n         // Header that specifies the size of the response body, in bytes
      \r\n                          // CRLF that marks the end of the headers

      // Response body
      abc                           // The string from the request
      ```

      The two headers are required for the client to be able to parse the response body. Note that each header ends in a CRLF, and the entire header section also ends in a CRLF.

      ### Tests

      The tester will execute your program like this:
      ```bash
      $ ./your_program.sh
      ```

      The tester will then send a `GET` request to the `/echo/{str}` endpoint on your server, with some random string.
      ```bash
      $ curl -v http://localhost:4221/echo/abc
      ```

      Your server must respond with a `200` response that contains the following parts:
      - `Content-Type` header set to `text/plain`.
      - `Content-Length` header set to the length of the given string.
      - Response body set to the given string.
      ```javascript
      HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\nContent-Type: text/plain\r\nContent-Length: 3\r\n\r\nabc
      ```

      ### Notes
      - For more information about HTTP responses, see the [MDN Web Docs on HTTP responses](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Messages#http_responses) or the [HTTP/1.1 specification](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9112#name-message).

  - slug: "fs3"
    name: "Read header"
    difficulty: easy
    description_md: |-
      In this stage, you'll implement the `/user-agent` endpoint, which reads the `User-Agent` request header and returns it in the response body.

      ### The `User-Agent` header

      The [`User-Agent`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/User-Agent) header describes the client's user agent.

      Your `/user-agent` endpoint must read the `User-Agent` header, and return it in your response body. Here's an example of a `/user-agent` request:
      ```javascript
      // Request line
      GET
      /user-agent
      HTTP/1.1
      \r\n

      // Headers
      Host: localhost:4221\r\n
      User-Agent: foobar/1.2.3\r\n  // Read this value
      Accept: */*\r\n
      \r\n

      // Request body (empty)
      ```

      Here is the expected response:
      ```javascript
      // Status line
      HTTP/1.1 200 OK               // Status code must be 200
      \r\n

      // Headers
      Content-Type: text/plain\r\n
      Content-Length: 12\r\n
      \r\n

      // Response body
      foobar/1.2.3                  // The value of `User-Agent`
      ```

      ### Tests

      The tester will execute your program like this:
      ```bash
      $ ./your_program.sh
      ```

      The tester will then send a `GET` request to the `/user-agent` endpoint on your server. The request will have a `User-Agent` header.
      ```bash
      $ curl -v --header "User-Agent: foobar/1.2.3" http://localhost:4221/user-agent
      ```

      Your server must respond with a `200` response that contains the following parts:
      - `Content-Type` header set to `text/plain`.
      - `Content-Length` header set to the length of the `User-Agent` value.
      - Message body set to the `User-Agent` value.
      ```javascript
      HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\nContent-Type: text/plain\r\nContent-Length: 12\r\n\r\nfoobar/1.2.3
      ```

      The tester will execute your program like this:
      ```bash
      $ ./your_program.sh
      ```

      Then, the tester will create multiple concurrent TCP connections to your server. (The exact number of connections is determined at random.) After that, the tester will send a single `GET` request through each of the connections.
      ```bash
      $ (sleep 3 && printf "GET / HTTP/1.1\r\n\r\n") | nc localhost 4221 &
      $ (sleep 3 && printf "GET / HTTP/1.1\r\n\r\n") | nc localhost 4221 &
      $ (sleep 3 && printf "GET / HTTP/1.1\r\n\r\n") | nc localhost 4221 &
      ```

      Your server must respond to each request with the following response:

      In this stage, you'll implement the `/files/{filename}` endpoint, which returns a requested file to the client.

      ### Tests
      The tester will execute your program with a `--directory` flag. The `--directory` flag specifies the directory where the files are stored, as an absolute path.
      ```
      $ ./your_program.sh --directory /tmp/
      ```

      The tester will then send two `GET` requests to the `/files/{filename}` endpoint on your server.

      #### First request
      The first request will ask for a file that exists in the files directory:
      ```
      $ echo -n 'Hello, World!' > /tmp/foo
      $ curl -i http://localhost:4221/files/foo
      ```

      Your server must respond with a `200` response that contains the following parts:
      - `Content-Type` header set to `application/octet-stream`.
      - `Content-Length` header set to the size of the file, in bytes.
      - Response body set to the file contents.
      ```
      HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\nContent-Type: application/octet-stream\r\nContent-Length: 13\r\n\r\nHello, World!
      ```

      #### Second request
      The second request will ask for a file that doesn't exist in the files directory:
      ```
      $ curl -i http://localhost:4221/files/non_existant_file
      ```

      Your server must respond with a `404` response:

    name: "Read request body"
    difficulty: medium
    description_md: |-
      In this stage, you'll add support for the `POST` method of the `/files/{filename}` endpoint, which accepts text from the client and creates a new file with that text.

      ### Request body

      A request body is used to send data from the client to the server.

      Here's an example of a `POST /files/{filename}` request:
      ```
      // Request line
      POST /files/number HTTP/1.1
      \r\n

      // Headers
      Host: localhost:4221\r\n
      User-Agent: curl/7.64.1\r\n
      Accept: */*\r\n
      Content-Type: application/octet-stream  // Header that specifies the format of the request body
      Content-Length: 5\r\n                   // Header that specifies the size of the request body, in bytes
      \r\n

      // Request Body
      12345
      ```

      ### Tests

      The tester will execute your program with a `--directory` flag. The `--directory` flag specifies the directory to create the file in, as an absolute path.
      ```
      $ ./your_program.sh --directory /tmp/
      ```

      The tester will then send a `POST` request to the `/files/{filename}` endpoint on your server, with the following parts:
      - `Content-Type` header set to `application/octet-stream`.
      - `Content-Length` header set to the size of the request body, in bytes.
      - Request body set to some random text.

      ```
      $ curl -v --data "12345" -H "Content-Type: application/octet-stream" http://localhost:4221/files/file_123
      ```

      Your server must return a `201` response:
      ```
      HTTP/1.1 201 Created\r\n\r\n
      ```

      Your server must also create a new file in the files directory, with the following requirements:
      - The filename must equal the `filename` parameter in the endpoint.
      - The file must contain the contents of the request body.

  # HTTP Compression

  - slug: "df4"
    primary_extension_slug: "http-compression"
    name: "Compression headers"
    difficulty: easy
    description_md: |
      Welcome to the HTTP Compression extension! In this extension, you'll add support for [compression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_compression) to your HTTP server.

      In this stage, you'll add support for the `Accept-Encoding` and `Content-Encoding` headers.

      ### `Accept-Encoding` and `Content-Encoding`

      An HTTP client uses the `Accept-Encoding` header to specify the compression schemes it supports. In the following example, the client specifies that it supports the `gzip` compression scheme:
      ```
      > GET /echo/foo HTTP/1.1
      > Host: localhost:4221
      > User-Agent: curl/7.81.0
      > Accept: */*
      > Accept-Encoding: gzip  // Client specifies it supports the gzip compression scheme.
      ```

      The server then chooses one of the compression schemes listed in `Accept-Encoding` and compresses the response body with it.

      Then, the server sends a response with the compressed body and a `Content-Encoding` header. `Content-Encoding` specifies the compression scheme that was used.

      In the following example, the response body is compressed with `gzip`:
      ```
      < HTTP/1.1 200 OK
      < Content-Encoding: gzip    // Server specifies that the response body is compressed with gzip.
      < Content-Type: text/plain  // Original media type of the body.
      < Content-Length: 23        // Size of the compressed body.
      < ...                       // Compressed body.
      ```

      If the server doesn't support any of the compression schemes specified by the client, then it will not compress the response body. Instead, it will send a standard response and omit the `Content-Encoding` header.

      For this extension, assume that your server only supports the `gzip` compression scheme.

      For this stage, you don't need to compress the body. You'll implement compression in a later stage.

      ### Tests

      The tester will execute your program like this:
      ```
      $ ./your_program.sh
      ```

      The tester will then send two `GET` requests to the `/echo/{str}` endpoint on your server.

      #### First request

      First, the tester will send a request with this header: `Accept-Encoding: gzip`.
      ```
      $ curl -v -H "Accept-Encoding: gzip" http://localhost:4221/echo/abc
      ```

      Your server's response must contain this header: `Content-Encoding: gzip`.
      ```
      HTTP/1.1 200 OK
      Content-Type: text/plain
      Content-Encoding: gzip

      ...  // Body omitted.
      ```

      #### Second request

      Next, the tester will send a request with this header: `Accept-Encoding: invalid-encoding`.
      ```
      $ curl -v -H "Accept-Encoding: invalid-encoding" http://localhost:4221/echo/abc
      ```

      Your server's response must not contain a `Content-Encoding` header:
      ```
      HTTP/1.1 200 OK
      Content-Type: text/plain

      ...  // Body omitted.
      ```

      ### Notes

      - You'll add support for `Accept-Encoding` headers with multiple compression schemes in a later stage.
      - There's another method for HTTP compression that uses the `TE` and `Transfer-Encoding` headers. We won't cover that method in this extension.
    marketing_md: |
      In this stage, you'll add support for reading the `Accept-Encoding` header sent by clients, and respond with `Content-Encoding` header in your response.

    name: "Multiple compression schemes"
    difficulty: medium
    description_md: |
      In this stage, you'll add support for `Accept-Encoding` headers that contain multiple compression schemes.

      ### Multiple compression schemes

      A client can specify that it supports multiple compression schemes by setting `Accept-Encoding` to a comma-separated list:
      ```
      Accept-Encoding: encoding-1, encoding-2, encoding-3
      ```

      For this extension, assume that your server only supports the `gzip` compression scheme.

      For this stage, you don't need to compress the body. You'll implement compression in a later stage.

      ### Tests

      The tester will execute your program like this:
      ```
      $ ./your_program.sh
      ```

      The tester will then send two `GET` requests to the `/echo/{str}` endpoint on your server.

      #### First request

      For the first request, the `Accept-Encoding` header will contain `gzip`, along with some invalid encodings:
      ```
      $ curl -v -H "Accept-Encoding: invalid-encoding-1, gzip, invalid-encoding-2" http://localhost:4221/echo/abc
      ```

      Your server's response must contain this header: `Content-Encoding: gzip`.
      ```javascript
      HTTP/1.1 200 OK
      Content-Type: text/plain
      Content-Encoding: gzip

      // Body omitted.
      ```

      #### Second request

      For the second request, the `Accept-Encoding` header will only contain invalid encodings:
      ```
      $ curl -v -H "Accept-Encoding: invalid-encoding-1, invalid-encoding-2" http://localhost:4221/echo/abc
      ```

      Your server's response must not contain a `Content-Encoding` header:
      ```javascript
      HTTP/1.1 200 OK
      Content-Type: text/plain

      // Body omitted.
      ```
    marketing_md: |
      In this stage, you'll add support for reading multiple compression values from `Accept-Encoding` header sent by clients, and respond with `Content-Encoding` header in your response.

    primary_extension_slug: "http-compression"
    name: "Gzip compression"
    difficulty: medium
    description_md: |
      In this stage, you'll add support for [`gzip` compression](https://www.gzip.org/) to your HTTP server.

      ### Tests

      The tester will execute your program like this:
      ```
      $ ./your_program.sh
      ```

      Then, the tester will send a `GET` request to the `/echo/{str}` endpoint on your server. The request will contain an `Accept-Encoding` header that includes `gzip`.
      ```
      $ curl -v -H "Accept-Encoding: gzip" http://localhost:4221/echo/abc | hexdump -C
      ```

      Your server's response must contain the following:
      - `200` response code.
      - `Content-Type` header set to `text/plain`.
      - `Content-Encoding` header set to `gzip`.
      - `Content-Length` header set to the size of the compressed body.
      - Response body set to the `gzip`-compressed `str` parameter.

      ```
      HTTP/1.1 200 OK
      Content-Encoding: gzip
      Content-Type: text/plain
      Content-Length: 23

      1F 8B 08 00 00 00 00 00  // Hexadecimal representation of the response body
      00 03 4B 4C 4A 06 00 C2
      41 24 35 03 00 00 00
      ```

      ### Notes

      - To check that your compressed body is correct, you can run `echo -n <uncompressed-str> | gzip | hexdump -C`.
      - It's normal for a very short string like `abc` to increase in size when compressed.
    marketing_md: |
      In this stage, you'll add support for encoding the response body using `gzip`.

  - slug: "ag9"
    name: "Connection persistence"
    difficulty: medium
    description_md: |-
      In this stage, you'll add support for persistent HTTP connections. By default, HTTP/1.1 connections are persistent, meaning the same TCP connection can be reused for multiple requests.

      ### Tests

      The tester will execute your program like this:
      ```bash
      $ ./your_program.sh
      ```

      The tester will then send two sequential requests over the same connection:
      ```bash
      $ curl --http1.1 -v http://localhost:4221/echo/banana --next http://localhost:4221/user-agent -H "User-Agent: blueberry/apple-blueberry"
      ```

      Your server must:
      1. Keep the TCP connection open after the first request
      2. Handle any subsequent requests on the same connection
      3. Return appropriate responses for both requests

      ### Notes
      - In HTTP/1.1, connections are persistent by default unless the client sends a `Connection: close` header
      - Each request must be processed independently, even if they're on the same connection
      - The server should not close the connection after each request

    marketing_md: |-
      In this stage, you'll add support for persistent HTTP connections, allowing multiple requests to be handled over the same TCP connection.

  - slug: "pe2"
    name: "Multiple persistent connections"
    difficulty: medium
    description_md: |-
      In this stage, you'll extend your server to handle multiple concurrent persistent connections.

      ### Tests

      The tester will execute your program like this:
      ```bash
      $ ./your_program.sh
      ```

      The tester will create two persistent connections and send multiple requests on each:
      ```bash
      $ curl --http1.1 -v http://localhost:4221/user-agent -H "User-Agent: orange/mango-grape" --next http://localhost:4221/echo/apple
      ```

      Your server must:
      1. Handle multiple concurrent TCP connections
      2. Keep each connection open for multiple requests
      3. Process requests independently on each connection
      4. Return appropriate responses for all requests

      ### Notes
      - Each connection should be handled independently
      - The server should maintain the state of each connection separately
      - Requests on different connections can be processed concurrently

    marketing_md: |-
      In this stage, you'll add support for handling multiple concurrent persistent connections.

  - slug: "pe3"
    name: "Connection closure"
    difficulty: medium
    description_md: |-
      In this stage, you'll add support for explicit connection closure using the `Connection: close` header.

      ### Tests

      The tester will execute your program like this:
      ```bash
      $ ./your_program.sh
      ```

      The tester will send two requests:
      1. A regular request that should keep the connection open
      2. A request with `Connection: close` header that should close the connection

      ```bash
      $ curl --http1.1 -v http://localhost:4221/echo/orange --next http://localhost:4221/ -H "Connection: close"
      ```

      Your server must:
      1. Keep the connection open after the first request
      2. Close the connection after the second request when `Connection: close` is present
      3. Include the `Connection: close` header in the response when closing the connection

      ### Notes
      - The `Connection: close` header indicates that the connection should be closed after the response
      - The server should include the same header in its response
      - After sending the response with `Connection: close`, the server should close the TCP connection

    marketing_md: |-
      In this stage, you'll add support for explicit connection closure using the Connection header.
