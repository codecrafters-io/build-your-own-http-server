In this stage, your server will extract the URL path from an HTTP request, and respond with either a `200` or `404`, depending on the path.

### HTTP request

An HTTP request is made up of three parts, each separated by a [CRLF](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CRLF) (`\r\n`):

1.  Request line.
2.  Zero or more headers, each ending with a CRLF.
3.  Optional request body.

Here's an example of an HTTP request:
```javascript
GET /index.html HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: localhost:4221\r\nUser-Agent: curl/7.64.1\r\nAccept: */*\r\n\r\n
```

Here's a breakdown of the request:
```javascript
// Request line
GET                          // HTTP method
/index.html                  // Request target
HTTP/1.1                     // HTTP version
\r\n                         // CRLF that marks the end of the request line

// Headers
Host: localhost:4221\r\n     // Header that specifies the server's host and port
User-Agent: curl/7.64.1\r\n  // Header that describes the client's user agent
Accept: */*\r\n              // Header that specifies which media types the client can accept
\r\n                         // CRLF that marks the end of the headers

// Request body (empty)
```

The "request target" specifies the URL path for this request. In this example, the URL path is `/index.html`.

Note that each header ends in a CRLF, and the entire header section also ends in a CRLF.

### Tests

The tester will execute your program like this:
```bash
$ ./your_program.sh
```

The tester will then send two HTTP requests to your server.

First, the tester will send a `GET` request, with a random string as the path:
```bash
$ curl -v http://localhost:4221/abcdefg
```

Your server must respond to this request with a `404` response:
```javascript
HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found\r\n\r\n
```

Then, the tester will send a `GET` request, with the path `/`:
```bash
$ curl -v http://localhost:4221
```

Your server must respond to this request with a `200` response:
```javascript
HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n\r\n
```

### Notes

- You can ignore the headers for now. You'll learn about parsing headers in a later stage.
- In this stage, the request target is written as a URL path. But the request target actually has [four possible formats](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9112#section-3.2). The URL path format is called the "origin form," and it's the most commonly used format. The other formats are used for more niche scenarios, like sending a request through a proxy.
- For more information about HTTP requests, see the [MDN Web Docs on HTTP requests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Messages#http_requests) or the [HTTP/1.1 specification](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9112#name-message).

Do not use the HTTP server utilities available in the standard library. Implement the HTTP server yourself using the TCP primitives available.
